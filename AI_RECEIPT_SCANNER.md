## Features
- ðŸ“· **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload receipt images (JPG, PNG)
- ðŸ¤– **AI Analysis**: Powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash for accurate OCR and data extraction
- ðŸ’° **Auto-Fill Form**: Extracted data automatically populates the transaction form
- âœ… **Smart Validation**: Validates file size (max 5MB) and image types
- ðŸŽ¯ **Category Matching**: Intelligently matches receipt data to your expense categories

## Error Handling

### Common Errors:
1. **"File size must be less than 5MB"**
   - Solution: Compress the image or use a smaller file

2. **"Only JPG and PNG images are supported"**
   - Solution: Convert image to JPG or PNG format

3. **"Not a valid receipt image"**
   - Solution: Ensure the image shows a clear receipt with visible text

4. **"Failed to scan receipt"**
   - Solution: Check internet connection and try again
   - The API may be temporarily unavailable

## AI Prompt Used
```javascript
Analyze this receipt image and extract the following information in JSON format:
- Total amount (just the number)
- Date (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD)
- Description or items purchased (brief summary)
- Merchant/store name
- Suggested category (one of: housing, transportation, groceries, utilities, entertainment, food, shopping, healthcare, education, personal, travel, insurance, gifts, bills, other-expense)

Only respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "amount": number,
  "date": "ISO date string",
  "description": "string",
  "merchantName": "string",
  "category": "string"
}

If it's not a receipt, return an empty object: {}
```

## Security Considerations
- âœ… CSRF token validation on all requests
- âœ… File size and type validation
- âœ… User authentication required
- âœ… Secure API key usage (server-side only)
- âœ… All uploads are processed server-side
- âœ… No client-side API key exposure

## Performance
- **Average scan time**: 3-5 seconds
- **Image encoding**: Base64 (automatic)
- **API timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Caching**: Not implemented (each scan is unique)

## Logging
All receipt scans are logged in the `ai_logs` table with:
- User ID
- Module: `receipt_scanner`
- Prompt: "Receipt image scan"
- Response: Full JSON data
- Metadata: File size and MIME type
- Success status

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Batch upload for multiple receipts
- [ ] Receipt image storage for audit trail
- [ ] Confidence score display
- [ ] Multi-language receipt support
- [ ] Receipt image preview before scanning
